It couldn't be uploaded due to its big size and compressing it would mean losing valuable insights. I recomend running it in collab and
adjusting the thread count if you have access to more computational resources.
It takes about 1.5-2h to download all of the images and to run ocr to extract certain components and the clustering weights can be adjusted for different results
